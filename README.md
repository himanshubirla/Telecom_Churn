# Telecom_Churn

#### Problem Statement
In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.

At a given point of time for any incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is a high priority. To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn. 

#### Findings

•	Since we can not see non value customer segment, we can state that they have not taken night packages
•	We can see that out of those customers who do frequent recharge, those who are non frequent night package user churns majority
•	Those who frequently recharge are the frequently night package user
•	We can say that non value customers and customers who rarely recharge are majorly churners
•	We can say that non frequent data user are majorly churners
•	We can say that non data user , customers are non value customer or rare recharge usage customer are the most churners
•	Average Revenue Month 6
•	Those who are average data user but does frequent recharge, the churn rate from this segment is just 8%. Their average revenue per user is also more for churners as compared to non churners , this is also because number of churners are less
•	Those who are average data user but does recharge mid frequently, the churn rate is 33%. Their average revenue per user is also more for churners as compared to non churners, this is also because number of churners are less, also the variation in data is significant
•	Those who are frequent data usage users and does frequent recharge, the churn rate is merely 2%. There is not that significant difference in the average of revenue per user

-	We see as frequency of recharge of a customer decreases , churners are greater than non churners

-	We see if a customer is not adding any value , proption of churn to non-churn is 85:15
-	We see if a customer is rarely recharging , proption of churn to non-churn is 80:20
-	We see if a customer is recharging moderately , proption of churn to non-churn is 33:67
-	We see if a customer is recharging frequently , proption of churn to non-churn is 15:85

•	We can not see data usage pattern having an affect on customer to churn

-	We see that night packs are only data packs , it does not affect call time

-	When night pack user value is 1 or 0 there is data recharge is done along with call time recharge, but for NA there is no data recharge or usage , only call time 

•	We see night pack usage does not affect customer to churn



•	Over the months of June and July churners on network minutes of usage is more than non churners for most of the clusters, only for users who are non data users and recharge rarely and also Non Frequent Data user and Recharge rarely have on network minutes of usage of churners less than non churners.
